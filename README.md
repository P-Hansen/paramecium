# Paramecium Zero

A simple simulation of microorganisms by Philip Hansen.

## Food
There are three kinds of food; yellow, orange, and white. Yellow and orange food is replenished when two waste particles collide. White food is produced on a timer from the green producers. Consuming the white food produces no waste. Some of the plants can also be eaten.
## Growth
Each organism looses health over time, this is reflected in its size. When food is consumed each organism grows and will divide after reaching its maximum size. When dividing there is a small chance to mutate producing new organisms or different colours. When an organism divides the number at the top left is also incremented by one. These points can be spent on special events. If all the organism die out the game will declare an extinction and restart.
## Events
Events each have a different effect on the environment. Some increase or decrease food, introduce new organism, or cause new plants to grow. Each of the events has a chance to happen randomly but can be triggered by spending the points on the top left of the screen.
